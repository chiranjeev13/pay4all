# Pay4All - Decentralized Tipping System


***LINK TO PRESENTATION*** - ```https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r0vLOzjY1dSu_ISG1dfZX1mQOxsdAf-L9fZJDW9rc5c/edit#slide=id.g1f35dd3024b_6_20```

The aim is to build a decentralised platform for payments by the public to municipal and sanitation workers.
The moral goal is to prevent small amounts of money being spent on harmful and largely unimportant goods on daily basis ; instead offer the aggregated payment/ tip money at a later time as a lumpsum ; this promotes money being put to good use. Along with it , it also aims to bring the blockchain use case to the grassroot level.
The technical goal is create a seamless platform that is transparent in displaying where the money flows by keeping a central aggregator and the user need only pay the unique wallet address corresponding to the worker.
